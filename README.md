I'm a software developer living in Huntington Beach, CA.
I worked for about 20 years with IBM's Software Group consulting
on development and configuration of Java application servers
and web service proxies.  Since 2016 I've been working for the
[Information Systems Advisory Board](http://ccjcc.lacounty.gov/Subcommittees-Task-Forces/Information-Systems-Advisory-Board-ISAB)
(ISAB) of Los Angeles County.

One could say I'm a full stack developer. But when referring to
myself, I don't mean it in the presumptuous sense that I'm an
expert in everything. It just means I can't find anyone else onto
whom I can confidently dump any part of the stack.
I think of myself as stuck under a full stack rather than
hovering above a stack with a magic wand.

One of the challenges of the stack is that the different parts
evolve at different speeds. These days, my stack is composed of

* __backend__ – MariaDB, DynamoDB, and SFTP servers on AWS
* __API Layer__ – Express/Node.js on docker/AWS Elastic Container Services
* __Front End__ – React/Redux on AWS CloudFront.
* __Desktop__ – Electron, TypeScript, Svelte, Rust and Tauri.
* __Infrastructure Scripting__ - Bash, Terraform, and AWS CloudFormation
* __Documentation__ – Docusaurus and Redoc
* __Traffic Analysis__ – Jupyter/Pandas/Python and D3.js
* __Integration Broker__ – Infor Cloverleaf
