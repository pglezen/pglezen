I'm a software developer living in Huntington Beach, CA.
I worked for about 20 years with IBM's Software Group consulting
on development and configuration of Java application servers
and web service proxies.  Since 2016 I've been working for the
[Information Systems Advisory Board](https://www.workshops.lacounty-isab.org/)
(ISAB) of Los Angeles County.

One could say I'm a full stack developer. But when referring to
myself, I don't wish to imply the presumptuous sense – that I'm an
expert in everything. Rather, it simply means I don't have anyone
else onto whom I can confidently dump any part of the stack.
I think of myself as stuck under a full stack rather than
hovering above it with a magic wand.

One of the challenges of the stack is that the different parts
evolve at different speeds. These days, my stack is composed of

* __backend__ – MariaDB, DynamoDB, and SFTP servers on AWS
* __API Layer__ – Express/Node.js on docker/AWS Elastic Container Services
* __Front End__ – React/Redux and SvelteKit on AWS CloudFront.
* __Desktop__ – Electron, TypeScript, Svelte, Rust and Tauri.
* __Infrastructure Scripting__ - Bash, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK
* __Documentation__ – [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/) and [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc), [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
* __Traffic Analysis__ – JupyterLab/Pandas/Python and [Observable](https://observablehq.com)/[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* __Integration Broker__ – Infor Cloverleaf, Tcl, Java, JavaScript, C
